# NameChanger
A simple utility to convert camelCase strings to snake_case strings, and vice-versa.

# Usage 
This program is run as follows: <code>python path/to/NameChanger.py [opperation] [file(s)]</code>. 

### Opperations
There are currently two opperations that this program can be run with
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Snake to Camel (<code>s2c</code>):</b>
    Converts all snake_case strings in the file(s) to camelCase ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Snake to Pascal (<code>s2p</code>):</b>
    Converts all snake_case strings in the file(s) to PascalCase ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> Camel to Snake (<code>c2s</code>):</b>
    Converts all camelCase strings in the file(s) to snake_case ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Camel to Pascal(<code>c2p</code>):</b>
    Converts all camelCase strings in the file(s) to PascalCase ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pascal to Camel (<code>p2c</code>):</b>
    Converts all PascalCase strings in the file(s) to camelCase ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b> Pascal to Snake (<code>p2s</code>):</b>
    Converts all PascalCase strings in the file(s) to snake_case ones.
  </li>
</ul>

### File(s)
The path(s) of file(s) to have names converted, file paths must be either an absolute path, or relative to the directory the script is being executed from. This program will accept any number of file paths, seperated by spaces. The provided opperation (s2c or c2s) is applied to all listed files.
